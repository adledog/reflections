It was very useful while working with code to be able
to only see the code that has changed while working
on it. That way, you don't get distracted by things
that aren't causing a new problem when it pops up.

You can look at the history of how you wrote a program
to see where you could have improved it. That way you
can write the program better and faster in the future.

It is nice that you get to commit whenever it makes 
sense for you. You can personalize how often you commit
to better suit your programming style, and you don't
have to worry about missing important changes.
However, it would be nice to not have to actively
worry about version control, and to not get messed
up by human error.

Git is designed for programming version control,
where keeping track of multiple files at the same
time is very common. However, in most circumstances
that functionality is not really needed. So services
like Google Docs, which is primarily meant for word
processing, don't include that feature.

Git log shows the list of commits and their
descriptions so you can find the change you are
looking for. You can then use git diff to find the
differences between that commit and the commit before 
it.

With version control you can very easily revert back
to a state you know is working, so you don't have to
worry about breaking anything.
