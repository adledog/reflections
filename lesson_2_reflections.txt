Initializing a repository creates the .git file that
tracks changes to the files in the git repository.
It needs to be done before you can use git bash to 
look through that history to see and mess with changes.

The staging area allows you to queue up changes to be
saved rather than forcing you to save the entire project
at once. This can be useful in situations where you might
have changs in multiple files, but not all of them are
ready to be comitted when you want to do a commit.
Using the staging area also makes git status show which
files have been altered and which haven't, so if there
is a file with a change you don't remember when you go
to make the commit you can inspect it to figure out 
why.

You can use the staging area to both check what has
changed between the changes you're thinking about saving
and the previous commit, and the differences between
what you're thinking about changing and everything you've
done since the previous commit. This way, you can be sure
that everything you're committing makes sense to commit
at the same time.

Branches would be useful in any situation in which you
want to try large changes that might or might not pan out,
or when you want multiple versions of a project that don't
interfere with each other.
